  REPTILES: {
    description: "Reptiles, belonging to the class Reptilia, represent a diverse group of cold-blooded vertebrates known for their scaly skin, internal fertilization, and usually, their laying of amniotic eggs. This class includes various well-known groups such as snakes, lizards, turtles, crocodilians, and tuataras. Reptiles inhabit a wide range of ecosystems, from deserts and grasslands to forests and wetlands, and can be found on every continent except Antarctica."

  MAMMALS: {
    description: "Mammals, belonging to the class Mammalia, are a diverse group of warm-blooded vertebrates distinguished by several key characteristics, including mammary glands that produce milk for nourishing their young, hair or fur covering their bodies, and a neocortex region in the brain associated with higher cognitive functions. Mammals inhabit nearly every terrestrial and aquatic habitat on Earth, from polar regions to tropical rainforests, and they can also be found in marine environments."

  ARTHROPODS: {
    description: " Arthropods, constituting the largest phylum within the Animal Kingdom, are a diverse and highly successful group of invertebrates characterized by their segmented bodies, exoskeletons made of chitin, and jointed appendages. This phylum encompasses a vast array of organisms, including insects, arachnids, crustaceans, and myriapods, which collectively inhabit nearly every terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem on Earth. One of the key features of arthropods is their segmented body plan, which is typically organized into distinct regions such as the head, thorax, and abdomen. This segmentation allows for flexibility and specialization of body parts, enabling arthropods to adapt to various ecological niches and lifestyles."

  BIRDS: {
    description: "Birds exhibit a wide range of adaptations that have enabled them to thrive in diverse habitats. Their feathers provide insulation, enable flight, and display vibrant colors used in courtship displays or camouflage. The structure of their beaks and feet often reflects their dietary habits and ecological niche, with variations ranging from long, probing bills for nectar-feeding hummingbirds to powerful talons for grasping prey in birds of prey like eagles and owls. Flight is one of the most distinctive features of birds, although not all birds are capable of sustained flight. Some, like penguins and ostriches, have adapted to a primarily terrestrial lifestyle, while others, such as albatrosses and swifts, are renowned for their incredible aerial prowess."

  FISH: {
    description: "One of the most distinctive features of fish is their adaptation to life in water. Their bodies are streamlined and hydrodynamic, allowing them to move efficiently through their aquatic habitats. Fins, which are supported by rays or spines, provide stability, maneuverability, and propulsion. The shape and placement of fins vary among species, reflecting their specific swimming behaviors and ecological roles. "

  AMPHIBIANS: {
    description: "One of the most notable features of amphibians is their ability to live both in water and on land, although they are typically dependent on aquatic habitats for breeding and larval development. Most amphibians begin their lives as aquatic larvae, such as tadpoles in frogs and newts, which breathe through gills and undergo metamorphosis into terrestrial adults with lungs and limbs. This dual life strategy allows amphibians to exploit diverse habitats and food resources. "
